# QuickLauncher
This is the first app I created in android studio. The app has a simple UI with 6 buttons. Each of the buttons have either a website name on it or an app name on it. If yu press the button whith a website name then it opens the url adress of the website and if you press the app button then it searches for the app in your phone and opens it. 
# Second activity
I also wanted to use second activity and transition between classes so I addded a simple calculator which adds two numbers.
